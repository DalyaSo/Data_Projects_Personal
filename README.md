# 📊 Personal Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics project portfolio. This repository showcases self-directed data analysis projects that reflect my interests, technical skill growth, and passion for uncovering actionable insights through data.

Each project explores a different business question or dataset and includes documentation, visualizations, and conclusions tailored to real-world applications. I use tools like **R**, **Tableau**, **Excel**, and **SQL**, depending on the goals of each analysis.
