# 📊 Personal Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics project portfolio. This repository showcases self-directed data analysis projects that reflect my interests, technical skill growth, and passion for uncovering actionable insights through data.

Each project explores a different business question or dataset and includes documentation, visualizations, and conclusions tailored to real-world applications. I use tools like **R**, **Tableau**, **Excel**, and **SQL**, depending on the goals of each analysis.

## 📁 Featured Project

### 🔹 [MLB Home Run Analysis](./mlb_home_run_analysis)

**Goal:** Explore historical MLB data to identify which positions consistently produce power hitters, examine debut age and career length trends, and surface player archetypes using long-term home run data.

- Dataset: [Lahman Baseball Database (1871–2024)](https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/)
- Tools: `R`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `cowplot`, `tidytext`
- Visuals: Line charts, heat maps, faceted bar charts, boxplots, scatterplots
- Key Takeaways:
  - Middle infielders show the steepest HR growth since 1980
  - Early debut + long career = strongest power profile
  - Catchers and shortstops still show the lowest HR ceilings

📂 Includes: Source code (`.ipynb`), visuals folder, README, license, and insights.
